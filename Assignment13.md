# Episode 13 - Time for the Test

## Theory

1. **What are the different types of testing?**  
**Answer:** There are several types of testing in software development, including:
    - **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
    - **Integration Testing:** Testing the interactions between different components or modules.
    - **Functional Testing:** Evaluating the application's functionality by testing it against its specifications.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Testing the entire application's workflow, simulating real user scenarios.
    - **Regression Testing:** Ensuring that new code changes don't break existing functionality.
    - **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the application's performance under various conditions.
    - **Security Testing:** Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's security.
    - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Validating the application's functionality from a user's perspective.

2. **What is Enzyme?**  
**Answer:** Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React applications. It provides a set of functions and APIs for testing React components' behavior and output. Enzyme allows you to perform actions like rendering components, interacting with them, and making assertions about their behavior.

3. **Enzyme vs React Testing Library**  
**Answer:** Enzyme and React Testing Library are both popular testing tools for React, but they have different philosophies and use cases.
    - **Enzyme:** Enzyme focuses on component-centric testing. It provides a wide range of APIs for testing components at different levels (shallow rendering, full rendering, etc.). Enzyme allows you to directly interact with component instances, making it suitable for complex component testing.
    - **React Testing Library:** React Testing Library encourages testing components as users would interact with them. It emphasizes testing from the user's perspective, so it's better suited for integration and end-to-end testing. It discourages direct manipulation of component instances and encourages testing based on accessibility and user interactions.

4. **What is Jest and why do we use it?**  
**Answer:** Jest is a JavaScript testing framework commonly used for testing JavaScript and React applications. It's known for its simplicity and developer-friendly experience. Some reasons to use Jest include:
    - **Zero Configuration:** Jest requires minimal configuration to get started.
    - **Fast and Concurrent:** It runs tests in parallel, speeding up test execution.
    - **Built-in Test Runner:** Jest includes its test runner, assertion library, and mocking utilities.
    - **Snapshot Testing:** Jest supports snapshot testing for UI components.
    - **Mocks:** It provides built-in mocking capabilities for modules and dependencies.
    - **Great Community Support:** Jest has a large and active community, making it easy to find help and resources.
