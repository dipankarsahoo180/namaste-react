# Episode 02 - Ignite our App

## Theory

1. **What is `NPM`?**
NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for JavaScript and the world's largest software registry. NPM is used to manage and install packages, libraries, and dependencies for Node.js applications.

2. **What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?**
Parcel and Webpack are both bundlers for JavaScript applications. They are used to bundle and optimize JavaScript, CSS, and other assets for web applications. They help improve performance and maintainability by efficiently handling dependencies and reducing the number of HTTP requests made by a web page.

3. **What is `.parcel-cache`?**
The `.parcel-cache` directory is used by Parcel to store cached data to speed up build processes. It helps in avoiding unnecessary recompilation and processing of files, improving the build performance.

4. **What is `npx`?**
`npx` is a package runner tool that comes with NPM. It is used to execute binaries from packages that are not globally installed. It allows you to run commands from packages in your project's `node_modules` directory without having to install them globally.

5. **What is the difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?**
`dependencies` are packages that are required for the application to run in a production environment. They include libraries and dependencies that are necessary for the application's core functionality.  
`devDependencies` are packages that are only needed during development and testing. They include tools, testing libraries, and build system dependencies.

6. **What is Tree Shaking?**
Tree shaking is a technique used by modern JavaScript bundlers to eliminate dead (unused) code from the final bundle. It helps reduce the bundle size by removing parts of imported libraries or modules that are not used in the application.

7. **What is Hot Module Replacement?**
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a development feature in bundlers like Webpack and Parcel. It allows for the real-time replacement of modules in a running application without requiring a full page refresh. This speeds up development by preserving the application state while updating only the changed modules.

8. **List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.**
Parcel's superpowers include fast bundling, automatic dependency resolution, hot module replacement, support for various asset types, and a zero-config setup. Three of these superpowers are:
    - **Fast Bundling:** Parcel excels in quickly bundling assets, making it a great choice for developers looking for a speedy development experience.
    - **Automatic Dependency Resolution:** Parcel automatically detects and resolves dependencies without the need for complex configuration.
    - **Zero-config Setup:** Parcel requires minimal configuration, making it easy for developers to get started without spending time on setup.

9. **What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?**
`.gitignore` is a configuration file used in Git repositories to specify files and directories that should be ignored (not tracked) by Git. Typically, you should add to `.gitignore`:
    - Files generated during the build process (e.g., compiled code).
    - Sensitive information like API keys or credentials.
    - Temporary files and directories.
    - Any files or directories that are not relevant to version control.

10. **What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?**
`package.json` is a metadata file that contains information about a Node.js project, including its dependencies, scripts, and other project-specific configurations.  
`package-lock.json` is automatically generated by NPM and is used to lock the version of every package's dependency. It ensures that the same versions of dependencies are used across different environments and builds.

11. **Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?**
You should not manually modify `package-lock.json` because it is automatically generated and managed by NPM. Any manual changes can lead to inconsistencies and dependency conflicts. It is meant to be a reliable and consistent reference for dependency versions.

12. **What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?**
`node_modules` is a directory that contains the dependencies (libraries) of a Node.js project. It is not a good idea to push the `node_modules` directory to Git because it can be very large and contains binary files. Instead, you should include `node_modules` in your `.gitignore` file and let developers install the dependencies locally using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

13. **What is the `dist` folder?**
The `dist` (distribution) folder is a directory that typically contains the output of a build process. It includes optimized and bundled code, assets, and other files ready for deployment to a production server. The contents of the `dist` folder are often the final files that are served to users.

14. **What is `browserlists`? Read about different bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel.**
It seems like "browserlists" might be a typo. It is more likely referring to "Browserslist," which is a configuration file used to specify a list of target browsers and their versions. This configuration is used by various build tools and bundlers to determine the compatibility of the generated code with different browsers.

15. **Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilda.**
The caret (^) and tilde (~) are version specifiers used in `package.json` to define dependency versions.
    - The caret (^) allows updates to the most recent major version while keeping the minor and patch versions fixed. For example, `^1.2.3` allows updates to any version within the `1.x.x` range.
    - The tilde (~) allows updates to the most recent minor version while keeping the major version fixed. For example, `~1.2.3` allows updates within the `1.2.x` range.

16. **Read about Script types in HTML (MDN Docs).**
Script types in HTML refer to the various attributes and options that can be used in the `<script>` tag to control how JavaScript code is loaded and executed in web pages. MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) provides detailed documentation on this topic.
